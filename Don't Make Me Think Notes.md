# Don't Make Me Think Notes

## Things to look up

1. Is there an UX/analytics style gem for Rails applications?
	* Track the number of times a specific link on a specific page is clicked. This *should* give you an idea of how important it is so that you can emphasize it (either by making it bigger, more central, etc.)
2. 

## Chapter 1: Don't Make Me Think

> I should be able to "get it"-what it is and how to use it- without expending any effort thinking about it.

Maybe from the home page we should have a "Getting Started" link. From here we have a step by step tutorial for getting tracks into the site.

* Create an account
* Download the plugin here
* Install it like so...
* Enter your API Key
* Follow the steps here

For our initial user tutorial, have a link to a "sample project" the user can download and open to follow along with the rest of the tutorial.

* Please lets make the tutorial as short and succint as possible

Homepage should have a clear and concise message that shows what Stem does

> Another needless source of question marks over people's heads is links and buttons that aren't obviouslly clickable

* For our dashboard page, should we change to having a dedicated "Go to project" button instead of having the text in the table row clickable?

Eliminate question marks

> The appearance of things (like size, color, and layout), their well chosen names, and small amounts of carefully crafted text should all work together to create a sense of nearly efortless understanding.

* Add a three step indicator to the plugin for how far along the track upload progress the user is:

[O --- O --- check] where circles get filled in with our Stem green

> If you can't make something self evident, make it self-explanatory

* In other words if they can't figure it out instantly then they should be able to quickly figure it out with the help of the above qualities

## Chapter 2: How we really use the web

### Three facts of real world web use

#### Fact of life #1: We don't read pages, we scan them.

* We're usually on a mission
* We know we don't *need* to read everything
* We're good at it (think about how much you scan Reddit)

> What we see when we look at a page depends on what we have in mind, and usually it's only a fraction of what's there.

* What is going to be on our user's mind when:
  * They're coming to our site (as a new user)
  * They're coming to our site (as an existing user)
  * They're coming to our plugin from the DAW

#### Fact of life #2: We don't make optimal choices. We satisfice.

Most of the time we don't choose the best option, we choose the __first reasonable option__, a strategy known as __satisficing__.

#### Fact of life #3: We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.

> For most of us, it doesn't matter to us whether we understand how things work, as long as we can use them. It's not for lack of intelligence, but for lack of caring. It's just not important to us.

## Chapter 3: Billboard Design 101

There are some important things you can do to make sure they see and understand as much of what they need to know - and of what you want them to know - as possible:

* Take advantage of conventions
* Create effective visual hierarchies
* Break pages up into clearly defined areas
* Make it obvious what's clickable
* Eliminate distractions
* Format content to support scanning

### Create effective visual hierarchies

1. The more important something is, the more prominent it is.
2. Things that are related logically are related visually.
3. Things are "nested" visually to show what's part of what.
  * Every newspaper page uses prominence, grouping, and nesting to give us useful information about the contents of the page before we read a word.

### Format text to support scanning

Important things you can do to make your pages scan-friendly

* Use plenty of headings
* Keep paragraphs short
* Use bulleted lists
* Highlight key terms


## Chapter 4: Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral?

> In general, I think it's safe to say that users don't mind a lot of clicks as long as each click is painless and they have continued confidence that they're on the right track.
