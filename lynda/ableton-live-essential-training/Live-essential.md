## System Setup

### What is a Digital Audio Workstation

1. A computer running a music production program (like Ableton Live, Garageband, FL Studio, etc.)

Optional other components include:

1. Microphone
2. Audio Interface which converts the audio signal from a microphone, guitar, bass, to a digital signal that can be processed by the program.
3. MIDI keyboard controller
4. Headphone/speakers which convert the output of the program to sound waves

Most of the processing is done by the computer
* 8 gigs of ram

Headphones/speakers
* reference headphones/speakers that don't color the sound. These offer neutral output so that you can get as close to the original as possible.

### Setting up Audio Preferences

Drivertype
	* On a Mac: Coreaudio
	* On a PC: ASIO

* Samplerate?
* Bitrate?


### What is MIDI and how do you set it up

* What is MIDI?
* How to use MIDI in Garageband

### Optimizing performance

* What is latency?
	* The time between playing the note and hearing it. Increasing the buffer size will decrease the load on the CPU but increase the latency. For most modern computers these days, you can get away with smaller buffer sizes and put a bit more stress on the CPU. 
	* 128 samples is a good starting point during recording
